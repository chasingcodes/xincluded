      <p>
        Welcome to Xincluded — a community-driven directory of races and running events that explicitly welcome and include non-binary participants! 🏳️‍⚧️      </p>
      <p><br>
        We believe everyone deserves the chance to participate in the sport they love, free from barriers or exclusion based on gender identity. Our platform helps runners find races with non-binary registration options, making the running community more inclusive, welcoming, and celebratory of everyone.      </p>
      <br>
      <h2 style="color: var(--secondary-color); margin-bottom: 1rem;">✨ Why I Started This</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Chase (they/he) — a non-binary triathlete who casually (and sometimes chaotically) does triathlons. Over the years, I’ve seen more races offer non-binary registration, which is amazing — but simply having the category doesn’t always mean the experience is inclusive.      </p>
      <p><br>
        That’s why I created Xincluded: a space powered by real feedback from real athletes. Here, we go beyond just listing races. You’ll find details like whether non-binary participants can podium and win prizes, if you can register with your chosen name, whether pronouns are acknowledged, if gender-neutral bathrooms are available, and much more. </p>
        <br>
      <h2 style="color: var(--secondary-color); margin-bottom: 1rem;">💪 Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        This isn’t just a database — it’s a growing, living resource shaped by the community. By sharing your experiences, you help other athletes feel seen, prepared, and welcomed. Together, we can keep pushing for a world where all athletes feel like they belong — on the start line, on the course, and at the finish. 🌈
